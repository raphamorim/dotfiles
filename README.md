###  Actual installation (for you)

1. Fork this repo
2. Open a terminal/shell and do this:

´´sh
export github_user=YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME
´´

´´sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/$github_user/raphaDotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc
´´sh

Since you'll be using the dotfiles command on subsequent runs, you'll only have to export the github_user variable for the initial install.

### Actual installation (for me)

´´sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/raphamorim/raphaDotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)" && source ~/.bashrc
´´
