#Rapha's Dotfiles

> This dotfiles about to rock your world

## About
I was tired of being configured manually every time changed my work machine. So I decided to create my own dotfiles, the problem is compatibility: The dotfiles should work on OS X, Debian and Ubuntu. The installation routine can be changed when OS change.

**My notes 'til now:**
Currently I do not know if the script identifies the operating system and change the routine. Or use the arguments within the script execution.

The second option seems to be more quiet, but it would be better the first option.
